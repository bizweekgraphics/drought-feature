Sales of Batiste Dry Shampoo have spiked 60 percent as Paulistas spend less time in the shower.

New pipes to an additional reservoir were to be ready in May. They've been delayed until this month.

A farmer in the Alto Tiete basin fears that the language in a recent decree declaring a water crisis gives water authorities the power to fine or even cut off the 95% of 5,000 farmers in Alto Tiete.

Sales of swimming pools at this roadside business have fallen 60 percent since the crisis began.

A resident in the outskirts of São Paulo heads for a plastic water storage tank she shares with other families.

Move all copy together so its under the video.
Separate the graphics (like in australia. Let me know if you need help with this)

In a city facility, ponds process wastewater. The end product is safe to use, but isn't potable.

Clockwise from top left: Processed wastewater heads for a construction site; there, it will be used to spray down dust, as required by environmental laws. Fresno residents with special badges can get free recycled water to use for gardening. A farm growing corn to be used as animal feed is irrigated with reclaimed water.
I feel like we need to break this up because there's no way you can see the captions and the top images at the same time currently

Clockwise from top left: A local chocolatier has switched to sanitation wipes to clean equipment. Some homeowners are turning to lawn painting to keep turf green. A plant nursery is adding drought-tolerant grass to its inventory. Purple pipes indicate nonpotable water supplies.

The water at a car wash falls into grates for recycling.

Clockwise from top left: Dye helps show whether a toilet is leaking. A city landscape conservation specialist tells a resident how to use a new kind of fixture. An inspector examines sprinklers to determine what's causing a leak.

Looks like no caption available for this one.

If you can get these changes in, it would be great. That way we can send this to the copydesk to review and potentially cut a few. (some of these photos seem a bit repetitive)

Let's change byline to say Photographs by Antoine Bruy (add an s to the end)
Adjust order so all text is together above the images, with graphics added on side/inline
I think we should break up the graphics, personally. Let me know if you need help tracking those down and what size they should be.

Ranchers in Queensland, Australia, dig pits, which they call “dams,” to catch rainwater. This one will run dry within weeks.

From left: A cattleman prepares to move 1,000 cows to a less arid ranch about 600 miles south. A driver takes a break sitting on the ramp where cows load on to the truck.

When there’s not enough grass for grazing, ranchers use bulldozers to drag 100-meter chains along the ground to tear down trees for the cows to eat.

In a wet year, Tamanick Station houses about 3,000 cows, but this year it has about half as many. Owner Jeffrey Blackett has another ranch, named Marlee Downs, that is even drier, so he moved much of that herd to Tamanick. Just 300 cows, a tenth as many as normal, remain at Marlee Downs.

The herd will be transported by a caravan of 10 double-decker trucks, known as “road trains.”

Owner Jeffrey Blackett fills up barrels with fuel to power his bulldozer, which he uses to push down Mulga trees for cattle to eat.

With grass in short supply, ranchers bring down mulga trees so cattle can feed on their leaves.

Ranchers buy cattle at an auction in Charters Towers. Prices are up because ranchers have culled their herds so much that there’s tight supply.

Ranchers sort through the herd in a process known as “drafting” to determine which cattle are healthy enough to make the long drive.
